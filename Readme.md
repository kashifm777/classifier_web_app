# CLASSIFIER WEB APP

This is a streamlit repository for classification web apps. We depend on following libraries:

* streamlit
* numpy
* matplotlib
* sklearn


We are using three different datasets, including:

1. Breast Cancer
2. Iris
3. wine

We are using following three classification models:

1. KNN
2. SVM
3. Random Forest

By creating a streamlit app, we can vary different factors in each model and incerase the accuracy of input dataset.
